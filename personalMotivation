# Reflection, Growth & Responsibility – A Personal Journey  

I believe I've found a way to share my thoughts and ideas with people who truly understand me. This not only allows me to record insights from my self-reflection process but also helps me focus on what’s essential in my daily life. At the same time, it puts my thoughts to the test – a sort of stress test to find out where I need to adjust.  

## Background & Family – Insights on Structure and Responsibility  

I grew up in a working-class household. It wasn't until later that I fully understood how much love my parents showed me from their perspective – and what challenges they faced due to their background and life circumstances. Looking back, I often ask myself: Would I have acted differently at 30 if I had been in their shoes? Sometimes yes, but only because I had the privilege of receiving a higher level of education and, with my analytical mindset, could recognize patterns faster.  

Two key pieces of wisdom I took from my family:  

1. **"Structure is important in life."** I used to dismiss this, but today I realize how essential it is.  
2. **"Take care when it matters."** My stepfather is a hard, pragmatic worker. We had communication difficulties, but his work ethic influenced me. Today, I can view many things with analytical distance – and sometimes even repair things retrospectively.  

## Career & Responsibility – Ethics in the Workplace  

I deeply value my current position and work environment. My goal is to **act for the benefit of all**. This is not about seeing myself as the "Master of the Universe" but about **leveraging strengths strategically and delegating weaknesses**.  

What does this mean in concrete terms?  

- I can think through and clearly communicate complex, abstract ideas – that's my strength.  
- I shouldn’t take on organizational responsibility – that’s not my realm.  
- I direct my energy for maximum impact – whether in personal conversations or in developing new ideas.  
- I act not just out of personal gain, but from an ethical standpoint.  

The full spectrum of my thoughts and ideas is something I’d like to make accessible to my company, with the goal of creating a business that is both economically successful and built on ethical values.  

## Mathematics – A Difficult but Meaningful Path  

My path to mathematics wasn’t straightforward. I initially pursued a different field but struggled with theoretical concepts. Instead of giving up, I decided to go back to basics, studying fundamental math on my own. This rekindled my passion, and I eventually switched to mathematics.  

One particularly influential figure—a supportive academic advisor—encouraged me with the words: **“Yes, this can work.”**  

Throughout my studies, I faced many challenges, including my master’s thesis. To be honest, I took the easier route when choosing my topic. I wanted something I could handle efficiently rather than getting lost in complexity. Still, the process tested me, and I had to push through difficulties. My advisor’s final email summed it up well:  

*"Thank you for the great and very interesting presentation. I hadn’t realized before how much depth was in this topic. I will grade the work soon."*  

Looking back, I wonder if that was just a polite way of saying, *"Well, at least it’s done."* Maybe it was. But in the end, it reinforced an important lesson: Sometimes, taking the practical path is the right choice. Not everything has to be an uphill battle.  

## Theory & Practice – A Lesson from a Side Job  

During my studies, I worked in a beer tent. A very experienced colleague, an absolute practitioner, took me under his wing. At first, I was awkward but quickly learned the essential tasks and was able to theorize the process. We worked like clockwork – until unforeseen situations arose. Then I often stood there dumbfounded, while my colleague immediately assessed the situation and responded. Only years later did I realize how crucial this experience was: **Structure is important, but flexibility decides success.**  

A defining experience: One Saturday at a packed beer tent, an inexperienced colleague by my side – we should have actually been three people. No time for long discussions, no room for mistakes. Instinctively, I took over the tap system and gave him clear instructions. If we had swapped roles, we would have failed. A perfect example of balancing theory and practice.  

## Education & Responsibility – What I Want to Take Away  

For a long time, I felt like an "unfinished" mathematician. Today I realize what I lacked: a vision grounded in reality. I never really understood physics – I found the methodology fascinating, but the bigger picture was missing. Now, with more life experience, I see abstract mathematics as a tool to solve real-world problems. But instead of diving into research myself, I use my knowledge where I can have the greatest impact: in my current environment.  

I am aware that I owe my education to society. From this, I feel a responsibility: Education should not only bring personal advantages but also be a tool to advance the collective. **My goal is not maximum financial enrichment, but a secure foundation to positively influence my environment.**  

## Final Thoughts  

This text should have been finished long ago – my plan was to start at 23:45 and finish by 02:00 at the latest. Now it’s 02:30. I have an appointment tomorrow at 09:00 with a colleague who has set aside time to discuss an internal matter with me. He has a busy schedule, and I appreciate the effort he is making. I have much more flexibility, so I recognize the privilege of being able to structure my time freely.  

That’s exactly why I’m stopping now – even though it will probably take me another half-hour to wrap everything up.
